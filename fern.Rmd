## The birth of Fern

On July 8, 2016 at 11:08pm, my daughter was born.  She is adorable.  Here she is on July 9.

## The contraction data

At about 6:15am on July 8, Fern's Mom started having contractions.  Our midwives said to call them once the contractions were consistently 3-4 minutes apart for at least one hour, and that the contractions themselves were between 45-90s in duration.  I started collecting data.

![Raw Data]

Here are the first (and last) six observations that I recorded.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(fasttime)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(plotly)
dat <-
    fread("contractionData.csv",
          colClasses = c("character", "integer")) %>%
      mutate(startTime = ifelse(startTime == "", NA,
                 paste0("2016-07-08 ", startTime, ":00"))) %>%
  mutate(contractionID = seq_along(startTime)) %>%
  select(contractionID, startTime, duration)

dat$startTime <- as.POSIXct(dat$startTime, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", tz = "UTC")
dat$duration  <-     seconds(dat$duration)
knitr:::kable(rbind(head(dat), tail(dat)))
```

Missing data are inevitable.

Of primary interest are the inter-contraction intervals.
```{r, warning = FALSE}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(interval = as.duration(startTime - lag(startTime)))
knitr:::kable(dat[5:10])
```

## Exploratory graphs

```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4}
intervalPlot <-
    dat %>%
    filter(!is.na(interval)) %>%
    ggplot() + theme_bw() + 
    geom_line(aes(contractionID, as.numeric(interval) / 60)) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(x = contractionID, ymin = 3, ymax = 4),
                alpha = 0.4) +
    scale_x_continuous("Contraction ID") +
   scale_y_continuous("Inter-contraction interval (min)\n(log scale)",
                      trans = "log", 
                      breaks = c(2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64))
print(intervalPlot)
```

The inter-contraction intervals are more variable and generally larger near the beginning of labour.  It looks like the intervals might converge on 3-4 minutes --- shown by the horizontal band --- just before we get ready to go to the hospital!  But what kind of model might determine such convergence?

## An initial model

It looks like the mean inter-contraction interval starts off somewhere near 30 minutes and then declines to asymptotically approach 3-4 minutes.  A model with these characteristics is given by the following.

$$ y = \kappa_1 e^{- \alpha x} + \kappa_2 (1 - e^{- \alpha x}) + \epsilon $$

where $y$ and $x$ are the inter-contraction interval and contraction ID, $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ are the initial and final inter-contraction times, $\alpha$ is a parameter controlling the rate of decline from $\kappa_1$ to $\kappa_2$, and $\epsilon$ is normally distributed error.

## Fitting the model

```{r}
plotCurve <- function(alpha, k1, k2) {
    x <- 1:nrow(dat)
    logy <- log(exp(k1) * exp(- alpha * x) + exp(k2) * (1 - exp(- alpha * x)))
    plot(x, logy, type = "l", ylim = c(0, log(55)), lwd = 3, las = 1,
         xlab = "Contraction ID", ylab = "Inter-contraction interval (min)")
    with(dat, lines(contractionID, log(as.numeric(interval) / 60)))
    abline(h = c(k1, k2), lty = 2)
}
plotCurve(0.014, 2.56, -5.9)

datNoNA <- dat %>%
  as_data_frame %>%
  filter(!is.na(interval))
nonLinearFormula <- 
    log(as.numeric(interval) / 60) ~
    log(exp(k1) *      exp(- alpha * contractionID) + 
        exp(k2) * (1 - exp(- alpha * contractionID)))
mod <- nls(nonLinearFormula, data = datNoNA, 
           start = list(alpha = 0.05, k1 = 3.5, k2 = 1.2),
           trace = TRUE)
do.call(plotCurve, as.list(coef(mod)))
summary(mod)

## confidence interval on the estimated asymptotic inter-contraction interval
k2Hat <- coef(mod)["k2"]
k2SE <- sqrt(vcov(mod)["k2", "k2"])
exp(k2Hat + c(lower = -1.96 * k2SE, estimate = 0, upper = 1.96 * k2SE))
```
